    <p align="center"><small><i>Blog posted on 25/11/2014</i></small></p>
    <p align="center">Patch 4.20, the first of the pre-season landed a little over a week ago and it's
      affect on the rift has been somewhat significant. This is a provisional Solo Queue
      tier list.</p>

    <h2 align="center"><b>Top Lane</b></h2>
    <p align="center">Top lane currently seems to be dominated by a few limited styles: Dominate the lane, Bot lane roam focused and Farm to late game.<br />
      This is first identified via summoner spell choice, which present only 2 scenarios: teleport or ignite. This tier list should hopefully identify which<br />
      champions are dominating and you can pick a style which suits you.

  <dd class="blogWriting">The grand duelist is just that...the ultimate duelist. Recent adjustments could be seen as a buff more than a nerf
  as it actually enhances her 1 v 1 power, by increasing her<br /> same target damage by 15%. She shreds through towers
  with her <abbr title="E">Burst of Speed</abbr> increasing attack speed by 120% at max rank. Fiora fits into a nice place with the summoner spell issue.<br />
  She can claim full dominance in lane with ignite and go for the potential 1 v 1 kills in lane, leading to her snowballing her lane and increasing kill pressure
  in a split push scenario. However, Fiora can really destroy team fights if played strategically, with her assassin properties and immense speed presented you as an
  <abbr title="Attack Damage Carry">ADC's</abbr> worst nightmare. This gives <abbr title="Teleport">TP</abbr> validation with Fiora. Fiora has seen a consistently high winrate
  for a while now and this is uniform among all ELO brackets.<br />
  TL;DR:
  <ul>
    <li>Attempt to 1 v 1 enemy opponent with unprecedented dueling skill.</li>
    <li>Choose between split pushing enemy towers or grouping with teams and sniping squishies in team fights with ult</li>

  <dd class="blogWriting">The Queen of top lane can remain firmly seated in her throne, as her strength is yet to dwindle. With the cliche phrase 'Better Nerf Irelia' being tired but still relevant.<br /> With the likes of Riven, Renekton and Jax taking heavy nerfs a few patches back now, she is able to get through to her power spike unchecked. <br />
With her <abbr title="W">Hiten Style</abbr> she is able to slowly sustain in the lane, which makes repeated harrass less effective. Build Trinity force into full tank or Trinity force into Blade of the Ruined King then transition to tank but only if you are snowballing your lane. 
Irelia excels at sticking to squishy targets due to her speed and gap close with <abbr="Q">Bladesurge</abbr>, she is also extremely difficult to peel against given her passive which reduces the effectiveness of crowd control with the more enemy chmampions in a local radius.<br /> Irelia has two main options for level building, max E first or max W first. Both have clear advantages and paths, which gives you the freedom to choose your style or what is needed in that particular lane match-up. Maxing Hiten Style first gives greater sustain and more true damage upon activation. Whereas maxing equalibrium strike gives greater burst damage. The problem is essentially solved when you work out if you think you can kill in lane or if you would rather sustain and farm up till mid/late game. 
  <br />
  TL;DR:
  <ul>
    <li>Build Force Into blade if snowballing otherwise build tri force into full tank.</li>
    <li>Irelia is hard to peel against, chase down squishies in team fights.</li>
